### Clarifying Questions
1. **Topic Data**: The `pdfFiles` array lists specific topics and resources. Are these the only topics intended, or should the tool support adding more dynamically?
2. **Video Links**: Some topics have one video, others two. Is this intentional, and are the URLs placeholders or actual resources?
3. **Capstone Logic**: The capstone (FRQ6) is marked as a final challenge. Should it be locked until all other topics are completed?
4. **Grok Integration**: The prompt assumes Grok supports PDF attachments. Is this a fixed requirement, or should the tool adapt if Grok‚Äôs functionality changes?
